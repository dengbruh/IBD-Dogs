# MICB475-Group6 Lab Notebook

### Meetings
#### 2023-09-26
**Updates, Issues, Discussions**
- Project Ideas
  - Sharisse: Looking at the correlation of various personal hygiene practices and abiotic and biotic microbial diversity using the dorms dataset. Specifically, looking into whether factors like sheet wash frequency, last shower, and last wash day affects the microbial diversity of the dorm students and their environments. Another idea: Comparing the effect of Westernisation and modernization on microbial diversity. This would use the datasets from the Tanzania and Columbia studies.
  - Renz: Changes in microbiome from 6 months to 12 months between infants with/without iron supplement → how it relates to anemia
    - Look into the past papers that did anemia and supplements
  - Brian: comparing infant feeding preferences and anemia datasets, although these datasets seemed to have been done many times before
  - Max: Fecal microbial diversity of anaemic M and F in 6 months old and use that data to compare results with McClorry et. al who compared 12 months old and see if there is a correlation between anaemia development in 6 and 12 months
    - Fecal microbial diversity + systemic metabolism in male and female infants with anemia
      - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6290362/
    - Fecal microbial diversity + systemic metabolism in 6 month and 12 month with anemia
      - https://ojs.library.ubc.ca/index.php/UJEMI/article/view/198168/192809
    - Fecal microbial diversity between IDA infants receiving or not receiving iron supplementation (FeSO4)
      - https://ojs.library.ubc.ca/index.php/UJEMI/article/view/198250/192587
    - Fecal microbial diversity between breast milk diet and complete diet in anemic and normal 6 month infants

#### 2023-09-27
**Agenda**
- Update Chris & Evelyn on current progress
- Ask questions
**Updates, Issues, Discussions**
- Evelyn recommends using GitHub for codes and lab notebook
  - There is an additional (optional) module on how to use GitHub
- Datasets
  - Modernization vs Westernization research question has been proposed
- Hygiene practices research question has been proposed 
- Sourcing external data sets
  - Need to be very proactive, make sure papers have untouched territory
- Have plan B & C for current datasets
  - IBD in dogs vs humans (look for human IBD datasets) 
    - Make sure data has ascension code 
  - IBD in human papers to send to Chris (christopherwjlee@msl.ubc.ca)
    - The Inflammatory Bowel Disease Transcriptome and Metatranscriptome Meta-Analysis (IBD TaMMA) framework
    - Multi-omics of the gut microbial ecosystem in inflammatory bowel diseases
    - Gut microbiome signatures of Yorkshire Terrier enteropathy during disease and remission
    - Gut microbiome structure and metabolic activity in inflammatory bowel disease
    - Quantitative microbiome profiling disentangles inflammation- and bile duct obstruction-associated microbiota alterations across PSC/IBD diagnoses
